## This is the README for your extension "hello-inspirer-theme"
Hello there! Thank you so much for taking the time to check this out. :)

I created a theme for Visual Studio as a part of my portfolio. It is entitled "Hello Inspirer" because...
* I want it to remind the users to stay inspired, stay creative, and to find the things that would inspire them to open their laptop or computer and start working on that personal project or work that you set aside before
* I want it to remind ME that I need to be inspired with other developer's achievement and not beat myself up and think that I am not good enough

I am truly hoping that you can download and use this theme. :)
**Enjoy!**
